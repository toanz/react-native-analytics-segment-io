# A React Native wrapper for Segment Analytics

- [Installation](https://github.com/leoilab/react-native-analytics-segment-io#installation)
  * [iOS](https://github.com/leoilab/react-native-analytics-segment-io#ios)
  * [Android](https://github.com/leoilab/react-native-analytics-segment-io#android)
- [Usage](https://github.com/leoilab/react-native-analytics-segment-io#usage)
- [License](https://github.com/leoilab/react-native-analytics-segment-io#license)


# Installation

```
yarn add react-native-analytics-segment-io
```
```
react-native link react-native-analytics-segment-io
```

## iOS
Add `Analytics` framework to your Podfile.

```
pod 'Analytics'
```

### Device-based integration components

To add an [integration](https://segment.com/docs/sources/mobile/ios/#migrating-to-v3) with a Device-based Connection Mode, you must manually add that integration’s dependencies to the Podfile.

```
pod 'Segment-Mixpanel'
pod 'Segment-GoogleAnalytics'
```

The wrapper will automatically register the added components in the configuration when the SDK is initialized.

Supported integrations:

| Component           | Podfile                             |

## Android

Run `react-native link react-native-analytics-segment-io` to add the necessary lines to the build files. Alternatively, you can do this manually with the 2 following steps:

1. Add a reference to the project in `settings.gradle`:
```
include ':react-native-analytics-segment-io'
project(':react-native-analytics-segment-io').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-analytics-segment-io/android')
```

2. Add the dependency to the app's `build.gradle` file:
```
compile project(':react-native-analytics-segment-io')
```

When the build files are set up to include the library, add a dependency to the Segment SDK in the app's `build.gradle` file:
```
compile 'com.segment.analytics.android:analytics:x.x.x' // We have tested with version 4.2.6
```

Then sync Gradle, and add the analytics package to your `Application` class:
```
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
  return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
      new MainReactPackage(),
      new AnalyticsPackage()
  );
}
```

Your project is now ready to start calling functions on react-native-analytics-segment-io.

### enable() and disable()

The `enable()` and `disable()` methods are not available in the Segment SDK for Android, so they are not included in the Android version of this library.

### Why you need to add the Segment SDK manually

The Segment SDK is added to the library as a `provided` dependency, meaning that it is not included in the final build. That is why it is necessary to include the Segment SDK in the app's `build.gradle` file. This makes it easy to update the Segment SDK from the app, and it makes the app's build configuration the source of truth when it comes to Segment.

### Minimum React Native version

It is required to use React Native v0.46.4 or higher. This is because we use a feature in Java on the passed maps (`.toHashMap()`) that is introduced in that version.

### Device-based integration components

To add an [integration](https://segment.com/docs/sources/mobile/android/#migrating-to-v4) with a Device-based destination, you have to manually add that integration as a dependency to the app's `build.gradle` file.

For example:

```
compile 'com.segment.analytics.android.integrations:firebase:1.1.0'
compile 'com.segment.analytics.android.integrations:mixpanel:1.1.0'
```

The wrapper will automatically register the added components in the configuration when the SDK is present.

```js
import Analytics, { AnalyticsConstants } from 'react-native-analytics-segment-io'
```

- **Analytics.setup(key, options)**
- **Analytics.identify(userId, traits)**
- **Analytics.track(event, properties)**
